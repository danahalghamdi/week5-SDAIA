Instead of training a model from scratch, which can be computationally intensive and require vast amounts of data, you'll use a pre-trained model. This approach utilizes a model that has already learned rich language patterns from enormous datasets, giving you a powerful head start through transfer learning.\n","\n","In this lab, you will focus on fine-tuning **DistilBERT**, a lighter and faster version of the formidable BERT model, to classify recipe titles. This process demonstrates how to adapt a general purpose language model for a specialized task. You'll also see how tools from the Hugging Face ecosystem streamline many of the manual data preparation steps, such as tokenization and padding.\n","\n","This lab will guide you through the following essential steps:\n","\n","* Loading the pre-trained DistilBERT model along with its specific tokenizer.\n","* Preparing the recipe dataset using a custom `Dataset` class and an automated `DataCollatorWithPadding` for efficient batching.\n","* Implementing two fine-tuning strategies: one where you update the entire model and another, more efficient method where you only train the final few layers.\n","* Comparing the performance of both methods to evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.\n","* Testing your model(s) on new, unseen recipe titles to assess its generalization capabilities."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import

You have successfully moved beyond building models from scratch and have now fine-tuned a state-of-the-art transformer model for a custom text classification task.\n","\n","You began by loading a pre-trained DistilBERT model and saw firsthand how it simplifies the entire text-to-tensor pipeline. The main takeaway from your experiments is the effectiveness of **partial fine-tuning**. You demonstrated that by strategically freezing most of the model's layers and only updating the final, task-specific ones, you can achieve performance comparable to or even slightly better than fully fine-tuning the entire model. This insight is immensely valuable for practical applications, as it allows for significant savings in training time and computational resources without sacrificing quality.\n","\n","The skills you've developed here, loading and adapting pre-trained models, managing data with modern tools, and strategically choosing which parts of a model to train—are the building blocks for tackling a wide range of complex NLP challenges, from sentiment analysis to machine translation and beyond."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python
